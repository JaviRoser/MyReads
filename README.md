# Udacity Project #6: My Reads

## Project Overview

This application was built with ReactJS. My Reads app was divided into several components:

- Book.js: Contains book information. The cover, book title, and author's name
- BookShelf.js: Contains information about the three book shelfs.
	- Currently Reading 
	- Want to Read
	- Read
- BookSearch.js: Let search for a new book to add into any of the three shelfs 
- BooksMainPage.js: Display all books currently on the shelfs.  

These components are like JavaScript functions. They accept inputs ("props") and return elements to the screen

>This is the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this template is to save you time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. If you choose to start with this template, your job will be to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.
